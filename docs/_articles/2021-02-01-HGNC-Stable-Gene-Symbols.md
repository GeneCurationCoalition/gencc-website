# Short summary of the article
summary: Changes to gene symbols can be confusing and disruptive, especially when that gene is associated to a known phenotype, and may have been quoted in many publications, listed in testing panels,  or even be used by a patient support group.  The HGNC, who assigns gene symbols and names to all human genes, is aware of the potential widespread impact symbol changes can have.  GenCC is collaborating with the HGNC to ensure the long-term stability of gene symbols. Every gene with a curated disease association will be reviewed by the HGNC to check that there is nothing misleading, incorrect or offensive in the nomenclature. Any problematic gene symbols may be updated in line with revised HGNC guidelines, following consultation with the research community. After they have been reviewed gene symbols are marked as ‘stable’ on the HGNC website. It is hoped that some necessary change now will mean fewer changes in the future, as well as improved communication and data retrieval for everyone. HGNC have already stabilized the symbols of over 2000 genes and over 1000 of these have GenCC disease curations.
