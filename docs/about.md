## Why is the GenCC needed?
Several groups and resources provide information that pertains to the validity of gene-disease relationships; however, the standards and terminologies to define the evidence base for a gene’s role in disease are still evolving and the community is in need of trusted and harmonized sources that define the level of evidence for a gene’s role in disease. To tackle this issue, the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC) was formed.

The Gene Curation Coalition brings together groups engaged in the evaluation of gene-disease validity with a willingness to share data publicly, to develop consistent terminology for gene curation activities and to facilitate the consistent assessment of genes that have been reported in association with disease.

## The goals of the GenCC are as follows:
- Clarify the overlap between gene curation efforts
- Understand the aims, processes, information used, classification systems, and users of the different curation efforts
- Develop consistent terminology for validity assessment as well as inheritance, allelic requirement, and mechanism of disease
- Collaborate on gene curation projects
