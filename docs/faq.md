# What is the GenCC and why is it needed?
Several groups and resources provide information that pertains to the validity of gene-disease relationships; however, the standards and terminologies to define the evidence base for a gene’s role in disease are still evolving and the community is in need of trusted and harmonized sources that define the level of evidence for a gene’s role in disease. To tackle this issue, the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC) was formed.

The Gene Curation Coalition brings together groups engaged in the evaluation of gene-disease validity with a willingness to share data publicly, to develop consistent terminology for gene curation activities and to facilitate the consistent assessment of genes that have been reported in association with disease.

# What are the goals of the GenCC?
The GenCC is working to harmonize approaches to ensure gene-level resources are comparable and interoperable. This allows groups to work together most effectively and to provide consistent and useful resources for the community.

The goals of the GenCC are as follows:
- Understand the aims, processes, information used, classification systems, and users of the different gene curation efforts
- Develop consistent terminology for validity assessment as well as inheritance, allelic requirement, and mechanism of disease
- Develop the GenCC Database, a shared resource to bring together gene-level resources
- Collaborate to harmonize gene-disease curations

# What is gene-disease validity curation?
Gene-disease validity curation answers the question “Is a gene associated with disease?” A curation evaluates the evidence for a claim for a specific gene, disease, and mode of inheritance. 

# Can I submit to the database?
The GenCC does not currently accept individual submissions but new groups can join per guidance below.

# Can my group join the GenCC?
The GenCC consists of groups that provide widely used public gene curation resources for the genetics community or those whose curations adhere to ClinGen standards (Strande et al 2017). Curations with supportive evidence must be made publicly available on this website. If you feel that your group meets this curation standard, please contact us to inquire about joining the GenCC.

# Can I follow my favorite gene?
You cannot currently follow your favorite gene, but this feature will be available soon in a future release.

# Can I download the data from this site?
Yes, there are download buttons available on multiple screens throughout the website. However, due to licensing restrictions, a GenCC download only includes a partial data set. Curations from OMIM are not included in this set.

# Can I connect to this data set via an API?
Our future plans include making an API available for GenCC data consumers, but this is not yet available. Please sign up for announcements from GenCC here (link to sign up page)

# Some submitters with large public resources have very small data sets. Why is this? 
To test the process, some GenCC submitters have so far only submitted a small subset of their curation data. This data set will continue to expand over the coming months
