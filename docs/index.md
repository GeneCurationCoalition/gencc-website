section1:
  We are pleased to announce the launch of the [Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC) Database (DB)](http://search.thegencc.org). The [GenCC DB](http://search.thegencc.org) provides information pertaining to the validity of gene-disease relationships, with a current focus on Mendelian diseases. Curated gene-disease relationships are submitted by GenCC member organizations. The GenCC comprises organizations that currently provide online resources (e.g. ClinGen, DECIPHER, Genomics England PanelApp, OMIM, Orphanet, PanelApp Australia, TGMI’s G2P), as well diagnostic laboratories that have committed to sharing their internal curated gene-level knowledge (e.g. Ambry, Illumina, Invitae, Myriad Women’s Health, Mass General Brigham Laboratory for Molecular Medicine).
